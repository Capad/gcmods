## General file rules

All `*.pdf` files are scans of the CAD (Cardboard Aided Design) done on A4 paper.
All `*.jpg` files are the same scans, but reduced to the boarders of the template.

## Files in this repo

`drive_shield_picoboot_mod` is the small cut or drill-hole you should do when installing PicoBoot on DOL-001 to securely push the wires through.

`drive_shield_xeno_mod` is the two fold modification for XenoGC users, to allow "pot tweak" and eye-sight inspection of the mod installation.
In the future, I will make a 3D model of a bracket to be pushed in the hole, to allow for wired installation of wireless XenoGC (apparently it's better).
